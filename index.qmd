This presentation aims to organize our research efforts in a way that makes them transparent, reproducible, and in accordance with the best international standards.

Here is our itinerary:

## Some issues regarding the Global Syndemic project

* Lack of standards and guidelines regarding data collection, storage, analysis and sharing.
* Lack of a project and data management system.
* Need of sophisticated tools and techniques to analyze big datasets.

## What I can help with

It's important to note, that I'm not an expert in public health or environmental science. However, I have a strong background in data science and complex systems modeling. I can help with:

I leave the theorizing and interpretation efforts to the experts in the field.

"__The scientific research enterprise is built on a foundation of trust__. Scientists trust that the results reported by others are valid. Society trusts that the results of research reflect an honest attempt by scientists to describe the world accurately and without bias. __But this trust will endure only__ if the scientific community devotes itself to exemplifying and transmitting the values associated with ethical scientific conduct."

## There's a solution: Open Science {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
"Open Science is an umbrella term encompassing a multitude of assumptions about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination." [@fecher2014]

At a high-level, it can be defined as the following.

"__Open Science is scholarly research that is collaborative, transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly available.__" [@europeancommission2018]

## What is data after all? {.smaller}

* [Ackoff's DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid).
* Data < Information < Knowledge < Wisdom.
* Data _versus_ the interpretation of data.

## What is data after all? {.smaller}

Data is an abstraction of reality. It's a representation of the world around us. Without context, it has no meaning.

[![](images/picasso-1946-the-bull.jpg){fig-align="center"}](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83721/the-bull)

## Data engineering {.smaller .nostretch}

"__Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.__"

You can think data engineering as the __plumbing__ of data science.

## Data science {.smaller}

It's a confusing term, with many definitions and interpretations.

For some, data science is just statistics [@broman2013] (_hype statistics_). For others, it's a new interdisciplinary field that synthesizes statistics, informatics, computing, communication, management, and sociology [@cao2017].

The arguments about the difference between data science and statistics are not very good. So it's best to use a high-level definition: 

"__Data science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data.__" [@dhar2023]

## Data engineering _versus_ data science

<p style="padding-top:50px;">"Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend __from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data__, before it can be explored for useful nuggets." [@lohr2014].</p>

## Example of a reproducible research

‚ö†Ô∏è __NOT FINISHED__ ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Associations between the duration and quality of sleep of pregnant women in the third trimester with the duration of labor.

## Suggestions for the Global Syndemic project {.smaller}

‚ö†Ô∏è __NOT FINISHED__ ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Project and data management

1. __Use OSF as a project and data management system__
  * Implement OSF (Open Science Framework) as the central system for managing the project and associated data.
2. __Subprojects integration__
  * Integrate each subproject (e.g., scope review, data analysis, causal model, agent-based modeling) into the main project on OSF.

## Suggestions for the Global Syndemic project {.smaller}

#### Project and data management

3. __Protocol registration__
  * Register research protocols for both the main project and each subproject.
  * Ensure alignment of protocols before registration by using drafts.
4. __Open licenses__
  * Apply open licenses to both the data and the code to ensure transparency and accessibility.

## Suggestions for the Global Syndemic project {.smaller}

‚ö†Ô∏è __NOT FINISHED__ ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Data analysis

1. __Use Wickham's program for data analysis__
  * Follow the guidelines and methodologies proposed by Wickham (2023) when conducting data analyses.
  * Tidy and document all the code and data.
2. __Dynamic documents__
  * Utilize dynamic documents to maintain an updated and reproducible record of data analyses.

## Suggestions for the Global Syndemic project {.smaller}

‚ö†Ô∏è __NOT FINISHED__ ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Data analysis

3. __Programmatic approach__
  * Emphasize learning and applying programmatic methods for handling large datasets, as this is the most effective approach for managing and analyzing extensive data collections
4. Reproducible environments
  * Use reproducible environments to ensure that the data analysis is replicable and transparent.

## We need to work as a team

You're not alone in this journey. We're all in this together.
