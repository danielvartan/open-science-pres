  abstract = {The 21st century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights, and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This article provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science. This article is the first in the field to draw a comprehensive big picture, in addition to offering rich observations, lessons, and thinking about data science and analytics.},

  abstract = {Open Science is scholarly research that is collaborative, transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly available. The European Union will not remain competitive at the global level unless it promotes Open Science, and relatedly, Open Innovation. The time to act is now. At its core, Open Science aims at: “increasing research quality, boosting collaboration, speeding up the research process, making the assessment of research more transparent, promoting public access to scientific results, as well as introducing more people to academic research”. By taking advantage of Open Science, researchers can enhance the quality of curiosity-driven research, maximise the value and potential impact of their work to create new avenues of knowledge, and drive scientific progress and Open Innovation within Europe and beyond. Open Science also makes research more transparent and accessible to citizens, and helps involve citizens more actively in research activities. Open Science thus “provides policymakers, research institutions, funding bodies and researchers themselves with an opportunity to critically consider: what does and should count as high-quality research; what goals researchers should pursue; how research results should be evaluated and disseminated; and how research should be supported and embedded within society”. For Open Science to be successful, it must become embedded at every level and in every aspect of the scientific endeavour and not be perceived as separate from (or even in competition with) current practice. Open Science needs to stimulate research integrity and quality, which includes sensitivity to disciplinary differences and confidentiality issues around knowledge sharing. Open Science requires a systemic shift in current practices to bring transparency across the system, to ensure ongoing sustainability for the associated social and physical infrastructures, and to foster greater public trust in Science. To enable this, all stakeholders in research and its communication need to take responsibility for supporting Open Science activities, which includes appropriate financial and administrative support to ensure its long-term sustainability and minimize the bureaucratic burden on researchers. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Member States and the European Commission (EC) to act on and actively promote Open Science amongst their respective communities, and to regularly and openly monitor and report on progress. This document provides a prioritised set of actionable recommendations from the Open Science Policy Platform (OSPP; see Annex B for members) to achieve it. The OSPP members strongly recommend their urgent inclusion into FP9. These recommendations are the next step towards implementing the longer-term vision articulated by Open Science consultations and expert groups set up by the EC and other organisations in Europe and worldwide (see Annex C for a list of relevant documents). There will need to be further work done to advise on the implementation of the roadmap for Open Science, and to help identify a range of tools and approaches to monitor progress. The following recommendations target the major stakeholder groups represented by the OSPP and focus on publicly funded research. The roles of other important players in this ecosystem, such as SMEs, industry and NGOs, need to be explored at a later date. We recognise that some individuals and groups may fall into two or more stakeholder categories listed below, and we ask readers to identify with all groups that are most relevant to their functions and activities.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, the ‘Information Hierarchy’ and the ‘Knowledge Pyramid’ is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ‘taken-for-granted’ models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff’s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.},
